==================
- Executables are in bin/
- You might need to run chmod u+x SSL_L*.exe to give it permissions to execute.
- To execute a script, cd into bin/ and enter one of the following commands:
	- ./SSL_Infinite.exe <test_file.in>
	- ./SSL_LWindow.exe <test_file.in> <window_size>
	- ./SSL_LWinExe.exe <test_file.in> <window_size> <execution_units>
